=================

neural network library  
daniel ford 2015  

libdfr-neural is a C++ library that implements fully connected neural networks
with backpropagation for training  

networks are composable with as many layers as desired

current layer types: linear, sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, softmax

see the XOR test wrapper for example usage

the MNISTdigit wrapper shows how to use the library to recognize handwritten digits in the MNIST digit set
